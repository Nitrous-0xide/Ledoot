Ledoot is a personal project that just had a bunch of pages of random stuff i think of in one website.

The current deployment version is accessable via https://www.ledoot.vercel.app

Or you can download and edit it yourself, add custom pages and codes etc.

Recently Moved to github from replit becuase hosting isn't free anymore.
